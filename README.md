   # **newSkin**

   ## Announcement

   I will be leaving on February 4th to fulfill my mandatory military service in my country, and may not be able to continue developing this project for a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 1 year. If you possess the expertise to keep the project updated on a regular basis, please reach out to me before February 3rd.

# Building
   1. Clone the source with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/R3nzTheCodeGOD/newSkin.git`
   2. Build in Visual Studio 2017/19 with configuration "Your Region"

# Usage
   1. Compile source or <a href="https://github.com/R3nzTheCodeGOD/newSkin/releases/latest">download</a> compiled version.
   2. Use `newSkin_Injector` or inject the resulting DLL into the game yourself.
      - *Administrator* privilege may be needed if failed to inject.
      - League client can crash if injected before going into arena.
         - A workaround is to not inject until you are in the arena (you will need to be fast to not disrupt the game).
   3. Press <kbd>Insert</kbd> to bring up the menu.
   4. Select skin for you, your teammates, enemies, wards.

# Further optimizations
   If your CPU supports AVX / AVX2 / AVX-512 instruction set, you can enable it in project settings. This should result in more performant code, optimized for your CPU. Currently SSE2 instructions are selected in project settings.
